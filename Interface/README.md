# A point-and-click interface for proofs

This folder of the repository implements the 
front-end interface for the point-and-click system.
The back-end code for the tree-based goal state 
can be found in the `TreeMoves` folder.

The files relevant to the interface are `MotivatedProofPanel.lean` and `MotivatedProofList.lean`.

This folder also has other files that were used for experimenting with 
various designs for the interface.
